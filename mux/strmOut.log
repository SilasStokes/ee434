INFO (XSTRM-288): Performing automatic layer mapping because either the layer mapping information is not provided or the XST_AUTO_LM  value is used with the -layerMap option. Additionally, the  'xStrmOut_layerMap.txt' file has been generated and the mapping information has been added to it.
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

Summary of Options :
library                                 mux_lib
strmFile                                MUX2_X1_6.gds

INFO (XSTRM-223): 1. Translating cellView mux_lib/MUX2_X1/layout as STRUCTURE MUX2_X1.
INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the objectMap option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the objectMap option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream. For details on the objectMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
